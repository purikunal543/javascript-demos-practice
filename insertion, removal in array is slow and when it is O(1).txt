if you want to add something in the end of array (push) then its time complexity is O(1)
if you want to remove something from end of array (pop) then its time complexity is O(1)

But if you want to add or remove something from array from middle or start then its time complexity is O(N) because you have to shift
indexes as well by looping through so it make its time Complexity O(N)

Note
----------------------------
concat in javascript arr1.concat(arr2) -> adds element of arr2 in arr1

Mississauga
var obj={
a:'Hi',
b:'Bi'
}
var fn="function(a){ console.log('hello'+a+this.a); return true }";
var func=new Function("{ return "+fn+" };");
func.call(obj).call(obj,1)
